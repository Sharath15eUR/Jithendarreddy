using valgrind debugging 

for the function test1

the problem is with free(); placement
after using free() function again we are using pointer ptr

solution:
use free() function at the end to avoid memory leaks




for the function test2

here there is no free() function in the test2 
due to this there occurs memory loss(definitely loss)

solution:
use free function() at end



for the function test3

here free function is used inside the for loop
due to this there occurs heap lost

solution:
use free() function outside the for loop


for the function test4

here ptr is assigned to the NULL due to this there occurs
segmentation fault 

solution:
remove the statement ptr=NULL;
use free() at the end




for the function test 5

here there is no checking of data is equal to null or not
there is no free() function for both two dimensional array


solution:
check whether the ptr data is equal to null or not
and use proper free() functions
